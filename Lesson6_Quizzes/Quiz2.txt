Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

Two methods: appendChild() & insertBefore() .
The difference between  the two is that appendChild() adds a node after existing child nodes and is the last child of the parent however, the insertBefore() function specifies a different position for the node and does not have to be default the last child node.  



2.  List the six main objects that make up the browser object model. 

window object
history object
location object
navigator object
screen object
document object
